# RustConf Async/Await Class 2018

If you want to run the examples you'll need to have `cargo` and `rustc` installed:

1. It's recommended that you pin the directory to the `nightly-2018-07-14` compiler so the examples work
2. `cargo run --bin waker`
3. `cargo run --bin timer`
4. `cargo run --bin tiny`
